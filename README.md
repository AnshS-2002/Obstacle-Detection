# Obstacle-Detection
A basic Arduino project which detects any obstacle within a particular distance using echo pulses.
The serial plotter showing horizontal line depicts that the obstacle is farther from the detected range i.e 20cm and is stationary.
The graph shows disturbance when an obstacle is detected.
